For the sentence "Two cats chase one dog", my translation outputs
"liang zhi mao zhui yi zhi gou" and "liang zhi mao zhui yi tiao gou".
Google Translate outputs "Liǎng zhī māo zhuī yī zhǐ gǒu".
For the sentence "Yī gè jiàoshòu zhuī liǎng tiáo gǒu", my translation outputs
"A professor chases two dogs" and "One professor chases two dogs".
Google Translate outputs "A professor chasing two dogs".

In both cases, the general meaning is the same, and is kept between both versions.
Google Translate chooses one classifier when translating into Mandarin, and chooses
one translation of "yi", either "A" or "One", when translating into English. GT also
uses the progressive verb form "chasing", which is not in my translator's lexicon.

29a: exists x (student(x) ^ forall y (book(y) => read(x, y)))
29b: forall y (book(y) => exists x (student(x) ^ read(x, y)))
30: exists x (xuesheng(x) ^ forall y (shu(y) => duguo(x, y)))

For the sentence "A student read every book", Google Translate outputs "Yī gè xuéshēng dúle měi yī běn shū".
For the sentence "Yī gè xuéshēng dúguò měi běn shū", Google Translate outputs "A student read every book".

Google Translate picks a single translation for words that have multiple possible translations, like it did in Question 1.
Interestingly, GT uses "dúle" instead of "dugou", which incorporates a word that is not in my translator's lexicon.
